/**
 * Lesson 4.1: Summarizing Results with summarize
Objective: Use summarize to log a summary of the Map/Reduce process.

Explanation: The summarize stage runs after all map and reduce tasks, receiving summary with execution metrics (e.g., inputSummary, mapSummary, reduceSummary). Itâ€™s ideal for logging or reporting results. This lesson logs the number of processed records.

Deployment/Viewing Instructions: Same as Lesson 1.1; run and check the Execution Log for summary details.

Hands-On Coding Challenge:

Log the total number of processed Sales Orders.
