/**
 * Lesson 3.1: Post-Processing with afterSubmit
Objective: Use afterSubmit to log Sales Order details or trigger additional actions after saving.

Explanation: The afterSubmit entry point runs after the record is saved, receiving scriptContext with newRecord, oldRecord, and type. Itâ€™s suited for logging, notifications, or follow-up tasks. This lesson logs the saved total and customer.

Deployment/Viewing Instructions:

Save as ue_aftersubmit.js in the File Cabinet.
Deploy to Sales Order (same as Lesson 1.1).
Save a Sales Order, check the Execution Log for details.
Hands-On Coding Challenge:
Log the total and customer after saving.
