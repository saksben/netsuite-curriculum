/**
 * Lesson 2.1: Validating Data with beforeSubmit
Objective: Use beforeSubmit to validate Sales Order data before saving.

Explanation: The beforeSubmit entry point runs before the record is saved, receiving scriptContext with newRecord, oldRecord, and type (create/edit/delete). Itâ€™s perfect for validation, throwing an error to block submission if conditions fail. This lesson ensures a customer is selected.

Deployment/Viewing Instructions:

Save as ue_beforesubmit_validate.js in the File Cabinet.
Deploy to Sales Order (same as Lesson 1.1).
Attempt to save a Sales Order without a customer, check for the error message, and verify the Execution Log.
Hands-On Coding Challenge:
Block save if the Customer field is empty.
