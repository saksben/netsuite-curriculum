/**
 * Lesson 1: Making a Simple GET Request with get
Objective: Learn to fetch data from an external URL using https.get.

Explanation: https.get sends a GET request to a specified url, returning a Response object with properties like body (response content) and code (HTTP status code, e.g., 200 for success). Itâ€™s the simplest way to retrieve data from an API or webpage, ideal for read-only operations. Use a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) for testing in your sandbox.
Can use HTTPS to communicate between SuiteScript scripts, RESTlets, and SuiteTalk REST APIs without having to reauthenticate.

Deployment/Viewing Instructions:

Save the script file (e.g., https1_get.js) in the File Cabinet (Documents > Files > SuiteScripts).
Create a Suitelet Script record (Customization > Scripting > Scripts > New), set Script Type to Suitelet, and link your file.
Deploy it (Customization > Scripting > Script Deployments), set Status to Released, and note the External URL.
Open the URL in your browser, then check the Execution Log (Customization > Scripting > Script Deployments) for the response.
Hands-On Coding Challenge:
Fetch and log a sample post from JSONPlaceholder.

            title: 'GET Response',
            details: 'Status Code: ' + response.code + ', Body: ' + response.body
        });
        scriptContext.response.write('Check the Execution Log for results.');
