/**
 * Lesson 4: Sending Bulk Emails with sendBulk
Objective: Use email.sendBulk to send multiple emails efficiently.

Explanation: email.sendBulk sends multiple emails in one call, taking an array of email objects with the same options as send (author, recipients, etc.). Itâ€™s optimized for batch notifications, reducing script execution time compared to multiple send calls.

Deployment/Viewing Instructions:

Save as email4_sendbulk.js in the File Cabinet.
Deploy as a User Event Script on Sales Order with Status: Testing.
Save a Sales Order, then check the inboxes of recipients and the Execution Log.
Hands-On Coding Challenge:
Send bulk emails to two recipients with different messages.
